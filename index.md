# VR Tracker

Two verisions of this projects exist, one for [Windows](https://gitlab.liu.se/fribl68/index-pose-windows) and one for [Linux](https://gitlab.liu.se/fribl68/index-pose). Both versions work at the current point in time; however, the Windows version is most likely the one that will be developed more in the future. This is because some functionality of vr (specifically passthrough camera) is not supported on Linux.

Currently, recordings can be found in the Linux version [here](https://gitlab.liu.se/fribl68/index-pose/-/tree/master/good_recordings)
